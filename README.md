# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In most cases, the user's needs are one of the top priorities when developing a software product. A desirable and seemless user experience should typically be at the forefront of a developer's mind throughout the entire software development process. The user stories help out with this idea in such a way that the developers are given specific examples of what POV the story is from and what the story teller would like to be able to accomplish.



# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I plan to use many of the techniques and methodologies I learned throughout this course in my future when working to develop software. It seems as though an agile mindset is usually oone of the more efficient ways to develop software today. A couple of the most prominent techniques that have stood out to me as the most useful throughout this course have been daily standup meetings and have a well designed sprint. I feel as though daily standups with a good, open communication and well thought out sprints will help me in any future development roles.



# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

The definition of a "good" team member in a software development environment most likely varies depending on who is asked. To me, a good team member is not afraid to ask for help or admit when they are stuck. A good team member also knows when to offer advice and when to learn from others. There is always someone who knows more about certain topics and areas than others. As a good team member, it is important to recognize such situations and use them as learning experiences.
